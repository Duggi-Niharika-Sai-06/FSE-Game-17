## How to play
- **Objective**
    - The objective of the game is to match pairs of identical emojis while trying to maximize your score within the given time limit.
- **Rules**
    - The game consists of a grid of face-down emoji cards. Each card has an emoji hidden on its back.
    - To play, click on any two face-down cards in an attempt to reveal the emojis on their backs. If the emojis on the two revealed cards match, they will stay face up. If they don't match, they will be flipped back face down after a brief moment.
    - The game has a time limit, typically 60 seconds. You must complete as many matches as possible within this time.
    - The game ends when the time runs out.
    - If you successfully match all pairs of emojis before the time runs out, you win the game.
    - If you run out of time before matching all the pairs, the game is over, and you lose.
